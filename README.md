Steps on how we accomplished the activity:

1.  Create Git Repository for the activity
2.  Add the git collaborators (Members, groups, organizations, etc.)
3.  Clone the Repository to the VM
4.  Create roles directory
5.  Create the different .yml installation files inside each service directory
6.  Each member are assigned to do their respective services
9.  After finishing the playbooks for each service, we tested it for troubleshooting
10.  When there are no errors and the installations are succesful, the final changes were commited and pushed to the github repository
